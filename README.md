# Popular-Articles

This is an API based Articles viewing project.
I made this project as my such practice as working on REST api's.

"Popular Articles" - It fetches all the Popular Articles from NYT.com (New York Times) , and the filter option is available to filter the Articles such as most Shared/Emailed/Viewed and within the given period of time as 1 or 7 or 30 days.

This site made using nice color palette and better responsive UI/UX experience .
